## **EE708: Fundamentals of data science and machine intelligence**
This is a repository for following along with the course, EE708, (taken in the spring semester of my first year).
Description: 
- Assignments folder contains all the assignments, their dataset and documentation made by me in latex.
- Submissions folder contains the things I submitted officially for grading.
- There is a course project on building a company bankruptcy prediction model, which is a separate repo on my profile.
- The other folders are mostly irrelevant, just experimenting a bit currently.

Description of assignment topics:
- Assignment 1: Based on exploratory data analysis and inferential statistics.
- Assignment 2: Based on linear regression, polynomial regression, and logistic regression.
- Assignment 3: Based on K-Means Clustering and Hierarchal clustering.
- Assignment 4: Based on Decision Trees, Classification and Regression Trees and Gaussian Mixture Modelling.
- Assignment 5: Based on Artificial Neural Networks (from scratch!)
